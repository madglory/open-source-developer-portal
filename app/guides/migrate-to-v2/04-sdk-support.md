# Migrate to v2

## SDK support
New SDKs were released to facilitate calls to API v2, therefore youâ€™ll need to update accordingly. Officially maintained SDKs are available for [Ruby](https://github.com/Gamelocker/Gamelocker-v2-ruby), [Node.js](https://github.com/Gamelocker/Gamelocker-v2-node), and [Python](https://github.com/Gamelocker/Gamelocker-v2-python) with support for PHP coming at a later date. Reference the [SDK support](https://docsv2.gamelocker.app/#sdk-support) section in our API docs for more information on getting started.
