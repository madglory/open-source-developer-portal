# Account types

## Traditional accounts

A Traditional account can be established prior to interacting with your application by signing up on gamelocker.app, or can be created directly inline with the capture of the user's permission via Gamelockerâ€™s OAuth flow. In both of these cases, Gamelocker facilitates the onboarding process and (if necessary) additional identity verification.

##### Traditional CIP Verified

A Traditional CIP Verified Gamelocker account maintains full access to the Gamelocker platform and is able to transact with any account type. Since this account type requires additional identity vetting by Gamelocker, users need to provide standard Know Your Customer (KYC) information: name, date of birth, address, and last four digits of SSN. In addition to the above, a commercial account will need to provide business name, address, and EIN. For white label integrations, the Partner will need a Traditional CIP Verified account in order to create Customers.

##### Gamelocker Direct

A Direct account is a lightweight account that maintains partial platform capabilities. This type of account requires only a username and password with no added CIP verification steps. Since identity vetting is not required, a Direct account may only transact with a CIP verified account: (1) Traditional CIP Verified or (2) White Label Verified Customer.
