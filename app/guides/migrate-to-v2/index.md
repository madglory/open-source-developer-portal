# Migrate to v2

## Overview
The following guide will outline some of the underlying principles of our v2 API and provide guidance on upgrading your application from Gamelocker’s legacy v1 API. Reference our [v2 API docs](https://docsv2.gamelocker.app/) for more information on the functionality currently available.

Gamelocker’s v2 API supports most of the same features and functionality as API v1; methods that are not currently supported in v2 are under Product consideration. Any new functionality added to the Gamelocker platform will only be added to v2.

API v2 is a RESTful API. It follows best practices in its design and improves on the developer experience from the now legacy v1 API.
