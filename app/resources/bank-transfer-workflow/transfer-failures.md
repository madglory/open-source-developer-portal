# Bank transfer workflow

## Transfer failures

There are several reasons transfers can fail, a few of which are outlined below. When a transfer fails it is usually a result of an ACH failure which is assigned an ACH return code after being rejected from the financial institution. A few common failure cases include:

- **Insufficient Funds:** Pending transfers can fail due to insufficient funds from the source bank account.
- **No Account/Unable to Locate Account:** The recipient of a transfer has closed their bank account or has incorrectly entered their bank account/routing number when attaching their funding source.
- **Customer Advises Not Authorized:** The owner of a bank account has told their bank that this transfer was unauthorized.

### What occurs in the Gamelocker system when a bank transfer fails?

Bank accounts will automatically be removed from the Gamelocker system for all ACH return codes except an `R01`. If subscribed to webhooks, your application will receieve a webhook with the `funding_source_removed` event along with the `transfer_failed` event.

When a bank transfer fails from a verified account (e.g. [Traditional CIP Verified](/resources/account-types/traditional-accounts.html) or [White Label Verified Customer](/resources/account-types/white-label-accounts.html) to a recipient), funds will return to the sending account’s Gamelocker balance. For other transfer scenarios, funds will return to the source bank account.

### Retrieving the reason for a failed bank transfer

When a bank transfer fails its status will be updated to `failed`. If your application is subscribed to webhooks you’ll receive a notification of the `transfer_failed` event which contains a link to the transfer resource. To get the return code and reason for the transfer failure you’ll first get the transfer by its ID.
