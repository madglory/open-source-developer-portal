# Account types

Before designing your integration, you’ll want to be aware of the different account types that exist on the Gamelocker platform as well as their capabilities.

A key difference between Traditional accounts and White Label Customer accounts outlined in this article is the onboarding user experience as well as the interaction with Gamelocker. Traditional accounts access gamelocker.app to manage their account, whereas White Label Customer accounts are managed entirely via the API by the Traditional account that creates them.

Regardless of whether your application interacts with Traditional accounts or White Label Customer accounts, it’s important to note that in a transfer of money between two parties at least one account must be Customer Identity Program (CIP) verified. It’s your decision about which party completes this process, based on your business model, and you may want to have both parties complete CIP verification. In addition, we also require CIP verification as a part of a customer holding funds in the Gamelocker network.
