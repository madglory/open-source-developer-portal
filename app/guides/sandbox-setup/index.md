# Getting started

## Sandbox environment

The Sandbox environment is a complete replica of the Gamelocker production environment, supporting all of the same API endpoints. Applications should be built and tested against the Sandbox environment before being used in production.

#### Differences from Gamelocker production

- The Sandbox contains only test data and is completely separate from your production account
- Actual money is not sent or received as part of test transactions. Real financial data should never be used in the Sandbox
- The Sandbox web interface is available at `https://uat.gamelocker.app/`
- All API V2 endpoints have a base URL of `https://api-uat.gamelocker.app/` instead of `https://api.gamelocker.app`

## Sandbox account

To get started, the first thing you need is a Sandbox account. Youâ€™ll be able to test your code end-to-end after creating test accounts, and use test credentials to make API requests and verify the responses.

## Overview

1. Create a Sandbox account with a valid email address belonging to you
2. Generate API credentials using your Sandbox account
2. Get an SDK and enable Sandbox mode
