## Using Gamelocker.js for On-demand bank transfers
On-demand bank transfers allow Gamelocker white label partners to receive variable totals from a payer’s bank account via an ACH transaction—perfect for companies with usage-based business models, such as utilities or advertising platforms. No other third-party gateways or merchant accounts required, just your Gamelocker integration and payer authorization.

This is an account level setting for a white label partner. When enabled, the end user is presented with text on the bank selection screen within the IAV flow giving authorization to Gamelocker for future variable payments.
