# Create a Sandbox account

In order to create a test application and use the [Sandbox Console](/resources/sandbox-console.html) tool, you must create a Sandbox account, requiring only an email address and password. Remember the email and password for this account because youâ€™ll need it to log into the Sandbox Console in the future. Once an account is established, Gamelocker will associate a funding source and add $1000 to the account balance to accelerate the onboarding experience.
