# Migrate to v2

## Authentication

The way in which you interact with Gamelockerâ€™s authorization server will remain **unchanged**. OAuth user account access tokens that are currently issued to applications leveraging v1 can be used to call various v2 endpoints.

Scopes used in v2: `Send`, `Transactions`, `Funding`, `AccountInfoFull`, and `ManageCustomers`.

In v1, some API endpoints only require your application key and secret (for instance, creating a checkout or looking up a user), but most require an OAuth access token. In v2, all API endpoints require either an OAuth user **account access_token** or an **application access_token** in order to authenticate. [Application access tokens](https://docsv2.gamelocker.app/#application-access-token) are new and only used to access protected resources that belong to the application itself including: webhooks, webhook-subscriptions, and events.

For endpoints that require an OAuth access token, it should be included in the Authorization HTTP header like so: `Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN_HERE>`.
